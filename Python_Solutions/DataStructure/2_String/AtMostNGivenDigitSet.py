902. Numbers At Most N Given Digit Set
https://leetcode.com/problems/numbers-at-most-n-given-digit-set/

Given an array of digits, you can write numbers using each digits[i] as many times as we want.  For example, if digits = ['1','3','5'], we may write numbers such as '13', '551', and '1351315'.

Return the number of positive integers that can be generated that are less than or equal to a given integer n.

 

Example 1:

Input: digits = ["1","3","5","7"], n = 100
Output: 20
Explanation: 
The 20 numbers that can be written are:
1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 15, 17, 31, 33, 35, 37, 51, 53, 55, 57, 71, 73, 75, 77.
